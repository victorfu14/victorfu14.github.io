This course is taught by [Alexander Barvinok](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~barvinok/).

This course deals with a structure called lattice, which is somewhat a mathematical abstraction of the lattice pattern you see every day. It has some nice properties and applications, so let's study them.

<!-- By the way, I just realized there are lattices and crystals in combinatorics. Although they bear little resemblance to their chemistry counterparts (especially crystals), they still remind me of my Chemistry Olympiad days. I thought classifying moleculars/lattice cells by their symmetry operations was absolutely unbelievable. Now I realize it is just group algebra. -->
