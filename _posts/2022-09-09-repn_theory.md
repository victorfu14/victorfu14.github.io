I'm back at it again! Let's do some more combinatorics!

This course is taught by [David Speyer](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~speyer/). The course website is [here](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~speyer/668/).

If only I aced my Honors Algebra class. But I guess if I am doing okay in any topic in the Honors Algebra class it would be representation theory. So here we go.

The course actually has scribbled notes made collectively by student per instructor's request. So I'll post something I find interesting and potentially my final project (an expository paper or presentation in advanced combinatorics) here.
