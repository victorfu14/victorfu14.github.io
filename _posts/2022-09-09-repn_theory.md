I'm back at it again! Let's do some more combinatorics!

This course is taught by [David Speyer](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~speyer/). The course website is [here](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~speyer/668/).

If only I aced my Honors Algebra class. But I guess if I am doing okay in any topic in the Honors Algebra class it would be representation theory. So here we go.

The course actually has scribbled notes made collectively by student per instructor's request. It is [here](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~speyer/668/CourseNotes.pdf). So I'll post something I find interesting and potentially my final project (an expository paper or presentation in advanced combinatorics) here.

Here is an [expository paper](../../../../parts/comb/linearreduction.pdf) I wrote on the computational complexity of the bijection between combinatorial objects.

Here is [an article (in Chinese)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/GXY-9m86Yw-wOcH6gym40A) I wrote about one random thought that occurred to me when I was doing the homework sets.
