This is the course I took in 2021 Fall semester, and the instructor is Daniel Burns. The textbook is [*Probability and Random Processes*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0198847599/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_NCN7PHW26G51WKCGGB15) by Geoffrey Grimmett and David Stirzaker.

No measure theory is covered in this course.

Here are the (incomplete) notes I typesetted in $\LaTeX$: (most of the notes before the first midterm is VERY incomplete, 
most of the notes after mid October is examined to a certain extent, but there may still be mistakes and typos.) Feedbacks welcome!
