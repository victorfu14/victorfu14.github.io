It is snowing in Ann Arbor, right now, in mid April. It is a yearly Midwest tradition that never misses.
People hate it. I find it eerily beautiful.

Midwest is not a "nice" place in any sense. It does not have cozy weather. It does not have too much great scenery. It does not have a wonderfully developed economy. It does not have an excellent quality of life (especially, roads!).

But Midwest is a reality. It is a reality that stuck with you, high or low, happy or sad, in love or heartbroken. It is a reality that does not change (or always changes, if you think about the weather). It is a reminder of what life is - it is about dealing with reality.

And what else can I ask for? Is there a better feeling than pacing yourself in the snow, thinking about someone you care about, letting the melting snow mess up your hair and blur your glasses, being all alone but with the silent world, who shows you "life is an unexpected snow in the middle of April"?

There may be a happier feeling than this. But I wonder if there is a better feeling than this. Since the set of feelings does not have a unique maximal element when ordered by "better", I would put this feeling as maximal without hesitation.
