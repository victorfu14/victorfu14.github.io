> We have concluded that the trivial mathematics is, on the whole, useful, and that the real mathematics, on the whole, is not. â¸º G. H. Hardy

Hardy is both right and wrong at the same time. The thing is, people do math to make seemingly complicated things trivial. So real mathematics becomes useful after all.
