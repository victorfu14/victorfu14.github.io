Here lie my random thoughts in blog format. I do not claim to be a seasoned writer, especially in non-technical writing. But I have always wanted to write something. I have wondered where mid-size thought snippets fit the atmosphere of the platform and do not impose too much barrier to people to read (should they actually want to). I come to the conclusion that most social platforms are too promotional and have this or that login stuff. So I think, just do the old schooled way. It is just really random thoughts anyway.
